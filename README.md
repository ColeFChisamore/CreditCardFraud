# CreditCardFraud

Using Jupyter notebook to code in Python, I work with credit card fraud data to create an AI model to detect fraudulent claims.

I first look through the data to to compare real and fraudulent claims to find any major differences between their distributions. Then I start by creating a Random Forest Classifier model (from sklearn) and training it on 80% of the data. I analyze the results and create plots and visualizations that help me to see how well the model performed. I then go on to attempt undersampling on the training data in order to reduce the number of mislabeled claims in the test data.
